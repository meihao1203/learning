The Old Testament
GENESIS
Genesis 1

1.	In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
2	And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 
3.	And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
4	And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 
5	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. 
6.	And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
